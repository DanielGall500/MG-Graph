# Minimalist Grammar Size Calculator

A Rust-based web application for calculating the size of a Minimalist Grammar (MG). This tool allows linguists and computational syntax researchers to input an MG and get metrics on its size, helping analyze grammar complexity. Built with **Rust** for performance and reliability, and powered by **Actix-Web**.
